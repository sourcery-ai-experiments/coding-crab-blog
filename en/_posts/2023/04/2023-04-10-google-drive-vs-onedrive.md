## Conclusion

Google Drive and OneDrive have many similarities. Both require an account and can be used for free with limited storage space. On both, you can buy more storage space with a subscription and then have access to additional features. In addition, there are other products for both products to edit different documents.

Google Drive is a good cloud storage service that is suitable for collaboration with others. With Google Drive, you can easily work with other Google products. For these products, no subscription is required, and they are web-based or available as an app on mobile devices. Office documents can also be edited with Google Docs, Sheets, Slides.

OneDrive is installed by default on Windows systems and can be used with Office 365. However, a subscription from the user is required for Office 365. There is also a web version, but it does not have all the features like the desktop version.

Therefore, Google Drive is better suited for collaboration with other people. If each user has a Windows / Mac system with an Office 365 subscription, OneDrive is better suited, as the users are better acquainted with Office 365.
