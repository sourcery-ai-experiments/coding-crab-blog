In this post, you will learn how to set up Windows without a Microsoft Account (using a local account).

If you want to set up Windows, but you don't want to create a Microsoft Account, you can use a local account instead. With a local account, you don't have to create a new account and if you don't need to use Microsoft services like OneDrive.
