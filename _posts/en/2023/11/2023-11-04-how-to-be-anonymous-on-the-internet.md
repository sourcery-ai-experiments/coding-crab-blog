Learn how to be anonymous on the internet.

## Introduction

The Internet is a great place to find information, connect with other people and learn. However, it is also a place where your privacy and security can be at risk, as many companies collect and sell your data. This post will show you how to be anonymous on the internet by following a few simple steps.

**Note**: _This is not a complete guide. It only focuses on the basics and can be extended as you wish._

## Step 1: Use a secure and anonymous email

As a first step, you should use a secure and anonymous email address. My recommendation: [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail).

ProtonMail is a free email service from the Swiss company Proton. Proton focuses on privacy and also offers other services like ProtonVPN and ProtonDrive. Since Proton is based in Switzerland, it is subject to the Swiss Data Protection Act, which is one of the strictest in the world.

## Step 2: Use different passwords

Different passwords are one of the easiest ways to increase your security. This prevents someone from finding one of your passwords and having access to all your other accounts. To make it easier for you to manage your passwords, I recommend using a password manager. My recommendation: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com).

**Note**: With [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/) you can even host your own server.

## Step 3: Use a VPN

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP address. This makes it harder for third parties to track your activities on the internet. My recommendation: [ProtonVPN](https://proton.me/vpn).

## Step 4: Use a secure browser

A secure browser protects your privacy by blocking trackers and ads. My recommendation: [Brave](https://brave.com).

## Step 5: Use a secure messenger

With a secure messenger, you can send and receive messages encrypted. This includes end-to-end encryption. My recommendation: [Matrix](https://matrix.org).

With Matrix and [Element](https://element.io/), you can send encrypted messages and do voice and video calls. Matrix is an open protocol that is supported by many providers. Element is an open-source client for Matrix. It is comparable to Discord, as it works similarly. You can also host your own server.

Texts can be formatted with most Markdown elements. You can also send voice messages, share photos and videos, create polls, send files and much more.

## Step 6: Don't share personal information

Many people share sensitive information on the internet/ social media often without being aware of the consequences. In addition to the obvious ones like address, name, phone number, ... there are also some that are not so obvious. Here are some examples and their consequences:

| Information                           | Consequence                             |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Where you go/ When you are where      | Someone could stalk you                 |
| From when to when you are on vacation | Someone could break into your apartment |
| Hate, racism, ...                     | Someone could report/ sue you           |
| ...                                   | ...                                     |

And always remember that everything you share on the internet is visible to everyone. This includes family, friends, colleagues, ... Therefore, never share personal information and opinions publicly on the internet and on social media platforms if you don't want everyone to see them.

## Step 7: Use decentralized social media

Traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ... are centralized. This means that they are controlled by a company. This company can decide what you can see and what not. They can also collect and sell your data. Decentralized social media is different. It is not controlled by anyone and anyone can use it. Learn more about decentralized social media [here](https://fedi.tips/) or on my [blog](/tags/#fediverse).

## Step 8: Use an anonymous search engine

Instead of using Google or Bing, you should use an anonymous search engine. My recommendation: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)/ [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com).

Most search engines collect data about you and sell it or use it for improved search results. With DuckDuckGo or Brave Search, you can surf the internet without your data being collected.

## Step 9: Use privacy-friendly alternatives

Numerous existing services are not privacy-friendly. To protect your privacy, you should use privacy-friendly alternatives. You can find a list of privacy-friendly alternatives [in this post](/en/privacy-friendly-alternatives).

## Step 10: Use a secure operating system

There are many operating systems, but the most well-known ones are not secure. Microsoft Windows is one of the most well-known operating systems and since it is used by most inexperienced users, it is also the most popular target for hackers. In addition, like many other operating systems, it is not privacy-friendly.

To protect yourself from malware and from collecting your data, you should use a secure operating system. Maybe you have already heard of Linux. Linux is an operating system that is free and open source. This means that anyone can see and modify the source code. This way, everyone can see what the operating system is doing, and it is less likely to contain malware. In addition, Linux is privacy-friendly because it does not collect any data about you.

There are many distributions for Linux. Find out which one is best for you [here](https://distrochooser.de).
