In this post, you will learn how to add a shared Google Drive folder/ file to your Google Drive.

## Why add a shared folder/ file to your Drive?

If someone shares a folder/ file with you, you find it in the "_Shared with me_" section of your Google Drive. And if you have many shared folders or files, it can be difficult to find the one you are looking for.

Also, if you are using Google Drive for desktop, you will not see them. So if you add the folders and files to your Drive, you can define their location, and you can also open it in Drive for desktop.
