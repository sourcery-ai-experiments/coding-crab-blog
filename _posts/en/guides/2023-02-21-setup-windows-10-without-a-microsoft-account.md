In this post, you will learn how to set up Windows without a Microsoft Account (using a local account).

## Why would you want to do that?

If you want to set up Windows, but you don't want to create a Microsoft Account, you can use a local account instead. With a local account, you don't have to create a new account and if you don't need to use Microsoft services like OneDrive. If you later decide to use OneDrive, you can always install it and connect it.

Also, this is optimal when you want to set up Windows on a computer that is not connected to the internet or create a virtual machine.
