In this post, you will learn what Bitwarden is and how to install Bitwarden on your device.

## What is Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is a free and open source password manager to store your passwords and other sensitive information like credit card numbers in notes and files securely. It is available on the platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and the web. It is also available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge.

Bitwarden is free, but it also offers a premium version with additional features like 2FA, YubiKey support, etc. It is also possible to host your Bitwarden server and use it with your family, and friends. Bitwarden also is great for companies because it offers a business version with additional features like SSO and SAML.

## Why use Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is a great free alternative to proprietary password managers like LastPass, 1Password, etc. and to free password managers like KeePass. It has features like 2FA, autofill, and sync across all devices, which not all of the above mentioned password mangers have. Another feature is that you can share passwords with other users, which is great for families and friends, if you share a Netflix account for example.

## Why I use Bitwarden

I prefer Bitwarden over the other password managers because it is open source and free. My favorite features are the 2FA support and the autofill feature. Another reason is, that I can use Bitwarden on all my devices, and it can generate secure passwords for me. So I don't have to remember all my passwords, except for the master password and I have secure passwords for all my accounts.

## Register for a Bitwarden account

To use Bitwarden, you need to register for a free account.

1. Visit the [Bitwarden Sign Up page](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/register)
2. Fill in the form and click on the `Sign Up` button. Note that the master password is the password you will use to unlock your Bitwarden vault and that you will need to remember it. But it has to be secure, otherwise, other people can access your passwords.
3. You will receive an email with a link to verify your email address. Click on the link in the email.
4. You will be redirected to the Bitwarden login page. Enter your email address and password and click on the `Log In` button.
5. You successfully logged in to your Bitwarden account.

## Setup Bitwarden on your device
